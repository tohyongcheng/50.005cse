N+S Quiz 3


1.
For symmetric keys,
No. of keys needed = (N-1) + (N-2) + ... (1) = (N)*(N-/2)


For asymmetric keys,
No. of keys needed = 2*N (including both public and private keys)


2.
False. Alice can falsify evidence by creating her own message and encrypting it with the same symmetric key she shares with Bob.


3. 
	a. Alice sends Bob the MAC and the value of the hashed MAC (MD5)
	b. Bob uses the same H function on the MAC he receives
	c. Bob then compares the value he receives and the hashed value he gets from the MAC he receives
	d. If both are equal, the message's integrity is assured.


4.
  n = pq = 55
  z = (p-1)(q-1)-1 = 39
  z = 



5.
	a. No it is not possible. Alice requires a public key to at least identify her.
	
	b. Yes, it is possible. Alice encrypts the message with Bob's public key and send it to Bob. Bob can then decrypt it with his own private key. With this,
	we will not know that Alice is the one who sends the message.
